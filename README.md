# getDominantColorFromImage

## Challenges
Getting colors from an image sounds bit complex, but it was quite easy thanks to Canvas! But getting dominant color from an image is rather hard. Usuallly we can't tell the difference between `rgba(255,255,254,1)` and `rgba(255,255,255,1)` with our nake eyes. <div style="height: 200px; width: 200px; background: rgba(111,111,111,1);">hi</div>
